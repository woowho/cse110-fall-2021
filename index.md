# Alex's Personal Page

## A bit about myself:
I have been programming for quite a while now, and have done some significant work in Java, Python, and Go. I know C++ and JS pretty well, and have some idea of how C, assembly, and CSS works.

I love the great outdoors and love skiing over the winter.

Here are some of my favourite features of Markdown:
